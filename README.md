The Society for Vascular Surgery and the STS have defined a new classification system that provides a nomen- clature to facilitate the description and the reporting of aortic dissection.16 According to this classification system, type A describes any aortic dissection with an entry tear in zone 0, and type B includes any aortic dissection with an en- try tear in zone 1 or a more distal aortic zone. In addition to being identified as type B, the dissection is further classified with 2 subscripts B(pd) describing the most proximal zone of involvement (p) and the most distal zone of involvement (d) (Figure 2). For example, a TBAD with an entry tear in zone 4 with retrograde extension to the midaortic arch and antegrade extension to just above the aortic bifurcation would be described as B.2,9 Furthermore, TBAD acuity is defined as (1) complicated, (2) high risk, or (3) uncompli- cated (Figure 3).
